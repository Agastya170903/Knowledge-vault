#### **2. Core Practices of Indigenous Shamanism**

- **Trance & Altered States:**
    
    - Achieved through **drumming, chanting, dancing, fasting**, or **entheogens** (ayahuasca, peyote, San Pedro, psilocybin, tobacco).
        
- **Spirit Journeys:**
    
    - The shaman “travels” to **non-ordinary realms** (upper/lower worlds) to retrieve lost soul fragments, gain wisdom, or perform healing.
        
- **Ancestral Connection:**
    
    - Honoring **lineage spirits** as guides and protectors.
        
- **Ritual Healing:**
    
    - **Extraction** (removing spiritual blockages), **soul retrieval**, and **energy balancing**.
        
- **Divination:**
    
    - Using tools (bones, stones, visions) to **see beyond the physical** and guide decisions.

#### **5. Worldview & Cosmology**

- **Interconnectedness:** All beings (human, animal, plant, spirit) are part of **one living web**.
