#### **1. Definition & Context**

- **Lemuria** is a proposed **prehistoric lost continent** that once existed in the Indian or Pacific Ocean.
    
- It entered Western thought in the **19th century** as a **scientific hypothesis** (to explain similar flora/fauna in Madagascar, India, and Australia).
    
- It evolved into a **spiritual and esoteric narrative** — a **cradle of humanity**, like Atlantis, where **advanced beings lived in harmony with nature and divine law**.

#### **2. Historical Origins of the Idea**

- **Scientific Beginnings:**

- **Theosophical Evolution:**
    
    - **Helena Blavatsky** (The Secret Doctrine, 1888) reframed Lemuria as **home to the Third Root Race** — a spiritually-evolving humanity with psychic abilities.
        
- **Occult & Esoteric Writers:**
    
    - **Rudolf Steiner** described Lemurians as **proto-humans with immense spiritual perception**.
        
    - Later channelers & mystics (e.g., Edgar Cayce) claimed Lemurians migrated to Atlantis & the Americas before the cataclysm.
