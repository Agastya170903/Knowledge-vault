#### **1. Definition & Context**

- **Tantra** (Sanskrit: _“weave”_ or _“loom”_): A **spiritual technology** integrating **mantra (sound), yantra (geometry), and tantra (ritual)** to **transform consciousness**.
    
- Emerged around **5th–9th century CE** in **India, Nepal, and Tibet**, later influencing **Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain practices**.
    
- Unlike purely renunciate paths, Tantra embraces **embodied life** — using **desire, sensory experience, and energy** as tools for liberation.

#### **2. Core Principles of Tantra**

- **Shiva & Shakti:**
    
    - The **cosmic duality** — Shiva (pure consciousness) and Shakti (dynamic creative energy).
        
    - Awakening = **uniting these forces** within oneself.
        
- **Body as Temple:**
    
    - The **human body is a microcosm** of the universe.
        
    - Every breath, sense, and act can become **sacred practice** when done with awareness.
        
- **Liberation through Engagement:**
    
    - Rather than rejecting the world, Tantra teaches **transforming desire, fear, and emotion into pathways of awakening**.
