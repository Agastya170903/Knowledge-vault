#### **3. Core Principles (The 7 Hermetic Laws)**

_(From the Kybalion, a later Hermetic synthesis)_

1. **The Principle of Mentalism:** _“The All is Mind.”_ Reality is shaped by consciousness.
    
2. **The Principle of Correspondence:** _“As above, so below.”_ Macrocosm and microcosm reflect each other.
    
3. **The Principle of Vibration:** Everything is in motion; **frequency determines reality.**
    
4. **The Principle of Polarity:** Opposites are extremes of the same essence (light/dark, hot/cold).
    
5. **The Principle of Rhythm:** All things rise and fall in cycles.
    
6. **The Principle of Cause & Effect:** Nothing happens by chance; all is governed by law.
    
7. **The Principle of Gender:** Masculine and feminine principles exist in all creation.
