#### **4. Modern Understanding**

- **Psychological Lens:**
    
    - Jung linked chakras to **archetypes of individuation** (root = survival archetype, crown = self-transcendence).
        
- **Neuroscience:**
    
    - Chakras correlate with **nerve plexuses & endocrine glands** (e.g., root with adrenal glands, heart with thymus).
        
- **Energy Medicine:**
    
    - Used in Reiki, sound healing, and somatic therapies for trauma release and emotional balance.

#### **6. Risks & Cautions**

- **Premature Kundalini Awakening:** Forcing energy through blocked chakras can cause emotional breakdown or psychospiritual crisis.
    
- **Imbalance:** Overfocus on upper chakras (mysticism) without grounding (root/sacral) can lead to **dissociation**.
    
- **New Age Oversimplification:** Commercial “quick fixes” often ignore the **complex tantric context** of chakra work.
