### **Meditation & Awareness Training**

_(Layer 0: Foundations — Body, Mind & Sacred Science)_

---

#### **1. Definition & Context**

- **Meditation** is the practice of **deliberate attention training** — cultivating stillness, focus, or open awareness to access deeper layers of consciousness.
    
- **Awareness training** expands this into daily life — **learning to remain conscious in every action, emotion, and thought**.
    
- Rooted in **Vedic dhyana**, **Buddhist vipassana**, **Taoist inner alchemy**, and **modern mindfulness**, it’s both a **state** (being aware) and a **skill** (developed through practice).

#### **2. Major Meditation Approaches**

1. **Focused Attention (FA):**
    
    - Anchoring awareness on **breath, a mantra, or an object**.
        
    - Builds **concentration & mental stability**.
        
2. **Open Monitoring (OM):**
    
    - Observing sensations, thoughts, and emotions **without judgment**.
        
    - Used in **Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen** traditions.
        
3. **Loving-Kindness (Metta):**
    
    - Cultivating **compassion & goodwill** for self and others.
        
4. **Transcendental / Mantra Meditation:**
    
    - Using **repeated sacred sounds (e.g., OM)** to transcend ordinary thought.
        
5. **Dynamic & Somatic Practices:**
    
    - **Walking meditation, Qigong, Yoga Nidra** — integrating **awareness with movement & body scanning**.

#### **3. Awareness Training (Living Meditation)**

- **Mindful Action:** Bringing **deliberate awareness** into eating, speaking, working, and even cannabis use.
    
- **Emotional Literacy:** Observing emotions without suppression or over-identification.
    
- **Witness Consciousness:** Shifting identity from “I am my thoughts” → “I am the witness of thoughts.”

#### **4. Science & Modern Research**

- **Neuroplasticity:** Regular practice **rewires brain pathways**, improving focus and emotional regulation.
    
- **Stress Reduction:** Lowers cortisol; activates **parasympathetic nervous system** (rest-and-digest).
    
- **Default Mode Network (DMN):** Quieting the DMN reduces ego chatter, enabling **states of unity & flow** (similar to psychedelics).
