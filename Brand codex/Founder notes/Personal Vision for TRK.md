### **Who I Am**

I am not just a founder.  
I am a **seeker, a builder, and a cultural architect** reclaiming what was stolen — not just from me, but from us.

My journey began in disillusionment — from being dismissed as a “conspiracy theorist,” to breaking under the weight of expectations, to facing my own traumas and finding healing in cannabis, psychedelics, and spiritual practices.

Through that pain, I found purpose. Through that awakening, I found clarity.

### **Why I Built TRK**

TRK was born because **cannabis was never meant to be a crutch or a commodity.**  
It was a bridge. A teacher. A medicine.

For thousands of years, it was **Vijaya** — an ally in Ayurveda, a sacrament for sadhus, a tool for connecting with the divine. Then it was stripped away from us: criminalized, commodified, and rebranded for profit.

TRK exists to **reclaim cannabis** — for the farmers who grew it, for the seekers who used it to awaken, and for the generations who deserve to know its true story.

### **My Vision**

To build **The Republic** — not just a brand, but a living, breathing **cultural revolution**.  
A space where:

- **Cannabis is ritual, not routine.**
    
- **People become citizens, not customers.**
    
- **Heritage and myth meet modern science and culture.**
    
- **Community takes power back from corporations, colonizers, and policymakers.**

### **What I See for TRK**

- A **global republic of seekers**: Artists, farmers, healers, and rebels rebuilding cannabis culture together.
    
- **Mythos-infused products**: Every pipe, paper, and ritual kit tied to deeper stories and ceremonial practices.
    
- **Spaces of remembrance**: From pop-up circles to digital parliaments, where people reclaim their power, heal their pain, and awaken.
    
- **A cultural legacy**: TRK as the **global gold standard for cannabis culture** — rooted in India’s heritage but shaping the world’s future.
