## **TRK Vision**

To reclaim cannabis as a sacred, cultural, and spiritual tool — transforming it from a colonized, commodified product into a **global movement for healing, self-mastery, and cultural awakening.**

## **TRK Mission**

To **build a Republic** — a living ecosystem of seekers, creators, farmers, and rebels — where cannabis is celebrated not as a habit, but as a **ritual**. Through **products, storytelling, and community**, we aim to:

- **Reclaim** cannabis’ roots in Ayurveda, Indian heritage, and ancient rituals.
    
- **Educate** people on intentional, mindful, and transformative use.
    
- **Empower** individuals and communities to take sovereignty over their wellness, creativity, and spiritual journey.
    
- **Challenge** the systems that exploit, misinform, and commodify the plant.
