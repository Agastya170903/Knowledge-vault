## **TRK – Core Values**

### **1. Truth Over Illusion**

We refuse to accept the narratives sold to us — by governments, corporations, or culture. Cannabis is not a “drug.” It is a sacred plant, a mirror, a teacher. We exist to strip away the lies and bring back the truth: that Vijaya was always meant to awaken, not numb.

### **2. Reclamation of Heritage**

This plant is ours — rooted in Ayurveda, mythology, and thousands of years of indigenous farming and spiritual practices. TRK stands for reclaiming what colonization criminalized and commodified. We honor its **Indian origins** while bridging it to a global awakening movement.

### **3. Ritual Over Routine**

Cannabis is not for habit. It’s for intention. Every product we create, every story we tell, is designed to transform consumption into ceremony. We elevate smoking from pastime to **practice** — a tool for grounding, insight, and connection.

### **4. Community as Republic**

TRK is not a brand. It’s a **Republic** — a shared space where seekers, creators, farmers, and healers co-create culture. Power belongs in the hands of the people, not just the elites or billion-dollar corporations.

### **5. Depth Over Hype**

We’re not here to ride the “Green Rush.” We’re here to create a **cultural revolution**. No shallow stoner stereotypes, no empty trends. Everything we make — from content to product drops — reflects layered meaning, mythos, and purpose.

### **6. Creative Rebellion**

TRK exists to disrupt — to break free from the systems that silence, commodify, and exploit. We use design, story, and culture to challenge the mainstream narrative and invite people into a **living myth** that inspires action.

### **7. Sovereignty & Self-Mastery**

Cannabis isn’t a crutch. It’s a key. We guide people to use it for self-discovery, emotional healing, and inner alignment — **not escape.** Our Republic empowers individuals to reclaim their agency, their rituals, and their lives.
