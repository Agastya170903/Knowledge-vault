_Reclaiming Vijaya from criminalization, commodification, and cultural erasure._

---

### **Why This Matters**

Cannabis wasn’t always “weed.”  
It was **Vijaya** — a sacred ally in Ayurveda, tantra, and ancestral farming practices. It was used by **sadhus, shamans, and healers** for thousands of years as a tool for awakening, pain relief, and spiritual practice.

Colonization **erased and demonized this plant**:

- British colonial laws (e.g., Indian Hemp Drugs Commission, 1894) began regulating and taxing its use, stripping it from its ritual and healing contexts.
    
- Post-colonial governments upheld the stigma (e.g., India’s NDPS Act of 1985) — criminalizing local growers while global corporations now profit from the plant.
    
- Western “Green Rush” industries now make billions while **indigenous farmers & communities remain criminalized, impoverished, or excluded** from the market.

### **TRK’s Stance**

We aren’t just a cannabis brand.  
We are **a Republic reclaiming the plant** — for farmers, healers, and seekers.

**Our goals:**

- **Reclaim the narrative:** Educate on Vijaya’s cultural, spiritual, and Ayurvedic history.
    
- **Empower local communities:** Work with indigenous growers & small suppliers.
    
- **Shift perception:** Move cannabis from “stoner drug” back to **sacred plant ally**.
    
- **Challenge exploitation:** Call out systems where colonizers-turned-corporates profit from what they once banned.

### **Core Pillars of Decolonization**

1. **Cultural Reclamation**
    
    - Tell **untold histories** of cannabis in India, Africa, and indigenous cultures.
        
    - Share **mythological references** (e.g., Vijaya in Puranas, kaneh-bosm in Biblical texts).
        
2. **Economic Justice**
    
    - Support **indigenous & small-scale farmers** in India and globally.
        
    - Advocate for **fair trade cannabis** models.
        
3. **Policy & Advocacy**
    
    - Push for **decriminalization & regulation frameworks** that benefit local growers.
        
    - Collaborate with activists & policymakers to **reform outdated laws**.
        
4. **Education & Narrative-Building**
    
    - Launch campaigns like **"Cannabis Was Ours"** to **reframe cannabis as cultural heritage**.
        
    - Use storytelling (reels, long-form content, pop-ups) to decolonize cannabis conversations.

### **Integration with TRK Mythos**

- The **Republic narrative** frames cannabis users as **citizens reclaiming sovereignty**.
    
- The **10 Clans** represent **different ancestral paths** — each tied to a ritualistic form of consumption.
    
- **Founder voice:** You as a **cultural architect & activist** — explaining colonization and your mission to rebuild what was lost.
