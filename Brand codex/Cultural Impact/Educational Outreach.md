_Reclaiming cannabis through knowledge, ritual, and community._

### **1. Purpose**

To **re-educate the public** about cannabis — not as a recreational drug, but as **Vijaya**, a plant with roots in Ayurveda, spirituality, and indigenous heritage.  
We aim to **bridge ancient wisdom, modern science, and cultural activism** — empowering people to use cannabis consciously while challenging colonial-era stigma.
