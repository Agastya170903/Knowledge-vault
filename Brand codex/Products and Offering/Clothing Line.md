_Streetwear as myth. Fashion as ritual._

---

### **1. Brand Positioning**

- **Identity:** Luxury streetwear **infused with sacred symbology** (clan glyphs, myth fragments, Vijaya motifs).
    
- **Purpose:** Not just apparel — **initiation pieces** that carry meaning (citizens wear their clan identity).
    
- **Target Audience:**
    
    - Seekers & rebels (18–35) exploring culture, spirituality, and cannabis sovereignty.
        
    - **Influencers + early adopters** in art, wellness, and alt-culture spaces.

### **2. Product Strategy**

#### **A. Core Categories:**

- **Clan Tees & Hoodies:** Limited drops, each tied to a clan (e.g., _Ignis Fire Hoodie_).
    
- **Caps & Beanies:** Glyph-based headwear with subtle embroidery.
    
- **Ritual Scarves/Shawls:** Inspired by Ayurvedic & spiritual heritage.
    
- **Limited Collabs:** Artists, spiritual creators, or heritage craftspeople for **capsule drops**.
    

#### **B. Drop System:**

- **Drop 1 (Founder’s Capsule):**
    
    - 3–4 mythos-based t-shirts (clan-inspired + “Cannabis Was Ours” heritage print).
        
    - **Merge drop structure** (like you outlined before: €20, €15, €10 tiers).
        
- **Drop 2 (Clan Collection):**
    
    - 10 pieces (1 for each clan).
        
    - **Gamified release:** Unlock certain items only by being part of that clan in TRK’s digital ecosystem.

### **3. Design Language**

- **Colors:** Black, deep green, and gold accents.
    
- **Textures:** Streetwear cuts with **ritualistic patterns** (glyphs, mandalas, Sanskrit fragments).
    
- **Visual Storytelling:**
    
    - Negative space symbology (hidden meanings in prints).
        
    - **Serialized drops** — every piece tells part of a bigger mythos story.
