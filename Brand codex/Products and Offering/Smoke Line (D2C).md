_Accessories as sacred artifacts. Every piece tells a story._

---

### **1. Positioning**

- **Not “just smoking tools.”**  
    These are **ritual instruments** — designed to bring intention and mythos into every session.
    
- **Tied to Mythos:**  
    Each item links to a **clan** (Ignis, Aegir, etc.) or **ritual function** (grounding, activation, connection).
    
- **Target Audience:**  
    Conscious smokers, ritualists, artists, and seekers — **people who see smoking as more than recreation.**
