### **Key Principles Across All Phases:**

- **Myth-Driven Growth:** Every product, drop, and experience ties back to TRK mythology.
    
- **Community First:** Citizens (not customers) shape the Republic’s direction.
    
- **Sacred Positioning:** Cannabis as Vijaya — cultural sovereignty, not commodification.
