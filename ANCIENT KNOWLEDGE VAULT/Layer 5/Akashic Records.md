#### **3. Modern Understanding**

- **Psychological Interpretation:** The records may represent the **deep unconscious** — symbolic memory storage accessible in altered states.
    
- **Quantum & Holographic Theories:** Some modern physicists (e.g., Ervin Laszlo) suggest the Akashic field aligns with theories of a **quantum information field** or **holographic universe**.

#### **4. Risks & Cautions**
