### **Consciousness Mapping**

_(Layer 0: Foundations — Body, Mind & Sacred Science)_

---

#### **1. Definition & Context**

- **Consciousness mapping** refers to **charting the different states, layers, and dimensions of awareness** — from waking consciousness to altered states, mystical experiences, and transcendental awareness.
    
- It’s a framework for understanding **how human experience is structured** (mental, emotional, spiritual) and **how we can navigate it intentionally**.
    
- Appears across traditions: **Vedic koshas**, **Buddhist jhanas**, **Western psychology (Jung, Wilber)**, **modern neuroscience**, and **psychedelic research**.

#### **2. Historical Frameworks**

- **Vedic Koshas (Layers of Being):**
    
    - **Annamaya (physical body)**
        
    - **Pranamaya (energy body)**
        
    - **Manomaya (mental/emotional body)**
        
    - **Vijnanamaya (wisdom/intellect body)**
        
    - **Anandamaya (bliss body)**
        
- **Chakras & Nadis:** Mapping **energy centers** and subtle channels along the spine for spiritual ascent.
    
- **Buddhist States of Consciousness:**
    
    - **Jhanas (absorptive states)** for deep meditation.
        
    - **Six Realms** model of conditioned consciousness (human, god, hungry ghost, etc.).
        
- **Kabbalah:** **Tree of Life** as a symbolic map from the material to the divine.
    
- **Hermetic & Esoteric Systems:** “Planes of existence” (physical → astral → causal → divine).

#### **3. Modern & Psychological Maps**

- **Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory:**
    
    - Quadrants (I/We/It/Its) + stages of development (ego → transpersonal).
        
- **Robert Monroe’s Focus Levels:** Used in **astral projection research**: Focus 10 (body asleep), Focus 21 (beyond time-space), etc.
    
- **David Hawkins’ Scale of Consciousness:**
    
    - Emotional states from **shame (20)** to **enlightenment (700+)** measured by **energy frequency**.
        
- **Psychedelic Neuroscience:**
    
    - Research (Johns Hopkins, Imperial College London) shows DMT, psilocybin, and ayahuasca **reduce the brain’s default mode network**, increasing interconnectedness of consciousness.

#### **4. Why Map Consciousness?**

- **Personal Navigation:** Knowing where you are (e.g., trauma states vs flow states) helps in **self-regulation and growth**.
    
- **Spiritual Practice:** Provides **roadmaps for awakening** (kundalini journeys, meditation milestones).
    
- **Integration of Psychedelic States:** Helps make sense of profound visionary experiences.
    
- **Collective Mythos:** TRK can use these maps to **frame cannabis/psychedelics as gateways** to intentional consciousness expansion — not escapism.

#### **5. Tools & Practices**

- **Meditation & Breathwork:** Accessing different levels (from mindfulness to non-dual absorption).
    
- **Psychedelics:** Entheogens as **shortcuts to transpersonal states** (but needing integration).
    
- **Dreamwork & Lucid Dreaming:** Mapping subconscious patterns.
    
- **Journaling:** Documenting emotional states to **see developmental patterns**.
    
- **Biofeedback & Neurotech:** EEG, HRV, and VR-based consciousness exploration.

#### **6. Risks & Cautions**

- **Overidentification:** Getting “stuck” in maps (ego clinging to levels like “I’m at X stage”).
    
- **Spiritual Bypassing:** Using higher-state chasing to avoid real-world problems.
    
- **Destabilization:** Deep-state practices without grounding can trigger **psychospiritual crises**.
