#### **1. Definition & Context**

- **Sacred geometry** studies **patterns, shapes, and proportions** believed to underlie creation, consciousness, and the structure of the cosmos.
    
- It views geometry as **a language of the divine** — a universal blueprint encoded in **nature, art, architecture, and even human consciousness.**
    
- These geometric archetypes are used in **meditation, ritual, and visualization** to align with cosmic order and access deeper states of awareness.

#### **2. History & Evolution**

- **Ancient Egypt:**
    
    - Pyramid architecture aligned to **golden ratios** and cardinal directions.
        
    - **Flower of Life patterns** carved into the Temple of Osiris at Abydos.
        
- **Vedic India:**
    
    - **Sri Yantra:** Complex interlocking triangles symbolizing creation and cosmic balance.
        
    - Used for meditation and ritual as a **visual mantra.**
        
- **Greece & Pythagorean Thought:**
    
    - **Pythagoras:** Numbers as divine archetypes; “All is number.”
        
    - **Platonic Solids:** Five perfect 3D forms representing the classical elements (earth, water, air, fire, ether).
        
- **Medieval & Renaissance Europe:**
    
    - **Vitruvian Man (Leonardo):** Human proportions as a reflection of cosmic harmony.
        
    - **Cathedral architecture:** Rose windows, labyrinths, and sacred ratios.

#### **3. Modern Understanding**

- **Science & Geometry:**
    
    - **Fractals and self-similarity:** Geometry of growth patterns in plants, shells, galaxies.
        
    - **Golden Ratio (Phi):** Appears in nature, art, and design.
        
- **Esoteric Lens:**
    
    - **Geometry as meditation:** Visualizing patterns like the Flower of Life to align mind and body with universal order.
        
    - **Subtle energy mapping:** Geometric mandalas and yantras used to direct prana or consciousness.

#### **4. Core Symbols**

- **Circle:** Unity, infinity, wholeness.
    
- **Vesica Piscis:** Intersecting circles representing creation, duality merging.
    
- **Flower of Life:** Overlapping circles forming the matrix of existence.
    
- **Platonic Solids:**
    
    - **Tetrahedron (Fire)**
        
    - **Cube (Earth)**
        
    - **Octahedron (Air)**
        
    - **Icosahedron (Water)**
        
    - **Dodecahedron (Aether)**
        
- **Golden Ratio (Phi):** The proportion 1:1.618 — divine balance.

#### **5. Practical Applications**

- **Meditation:** Trataka (gazing meditation) on sacred patterns (e.g., yantras, mandalas).
    
- **Visualization:** Walking through 3D Platonic solids in astral meditations.
    
- **Design & Architecture:** Incorporating sacred proportions for spaces that promote calm and inspiration.
    
- **Personal Symbolism:** Using sacred geometry to create **sigils and personal glyphs** (like you’re doing with TRK).
