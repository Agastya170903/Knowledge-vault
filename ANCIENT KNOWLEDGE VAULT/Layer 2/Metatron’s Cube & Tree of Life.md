### **Metatron’s Cube & The Tree of Life**

_(Layer 2–5: Sacred Geometry & Soul Architecture)_

---

#### **1. Definition & Context**

- **Metatron’s Cube:**
    
    - A **complex geometric figure** derived from the **Fruit of Life** (a subset of the **Flower of Life**).
        
    - Contains **13 circles connected by straight lines** — forming the basis for **all 5 Platonic solids**, symbolizing **creation’s blueprint**.
        
    - Named after **Archangel Metatron**, the “scribe of God” in Jewish mysticism — a being who **translates divine will into form**.
        
- **Tree of Life (Etz Chaim):**
    
    - A **Kabbalistic diagram** of 10 interconnected spheres (**sefirot**) representing **emanations of divine energy**.
        
    - Acts as a **map of creation, the human psyche, and the soul’s journey** back to source.
        

When combined, these two symbols form a **holistic model of the universe** — geometry as the skeleton, Kabbalah as the living energy flow.
