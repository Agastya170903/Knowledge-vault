### **Sound Healing**

_(Layer 3: Energy & Frequency Technologies + Layer 0: Foundational Practices)_

---

#### **3. Modern Science of Sound Healing**

- **Brainwave Entrainment:**
    
    - Binaural beats & rhythmic drumming align brainwaves to **theta (deep relaxation) or gamma (heightened awareness)** states.
        
- **Cymatics:**
    
    - Sound frequencies create **geometric resonance patterns** in water and matter — proof that vibration **organizes form**.
        
- **Vagal Nerve Stimulation:**
    
    - Low-frequency humming and chanting activate the **parasympathetic nervous system**, reducing stress.
        
- **Cellular & DNA Resonance:**
    
    - Research suggests **528 Hz and similar frequencies** influence **cell repair and emotional regulation**.
