**Summary:**  
Proposals that major chunks of human history have been falsified, erased, or looped—creating a skewed perception of time, culture, and evolution.

**Key Concepts:**

- Phantom Time Hypothesis: suggests 297 years were fabricated during the early Middle Ages.
- Chronological layering of similar events under different names (e.g., "Jesus" repeating Horus, Krishna, Mithra, etc.).
- History as a manufactured control system.

**Applications:**

- Narrative tool: “We’re in a time echo” as a campaign message.
- Time-glitched aesthetics, looping date motifs.
