**Summary:**  
The idea that the afterlife cycle is manipulated by external intelligences—trapping souls in a loop of reincarnation via false light, memory wiping, or karmic contracts.

**Key Themes:**

- “Light tunnel” used to lure the dying back into rebirth.
- Memory erasure between lives prevents awareness of the trap.
- Entities posing as “guides” or “family” may be part of the system.

**Applications:**

- Lore metaphor for brand users who “awaken” to truth cycles.
- Symbolism: broken loops, spiral exits, mirror traps.
