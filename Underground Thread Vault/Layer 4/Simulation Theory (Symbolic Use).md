**Purpose:**  
Create a _meta-narrative_ where the brand world reflects the user’s sense of reality—hinting that “everything is part of the story.”

**Mechanics:**

- The world is framed as “glitched” or “coded” — aligning with brand themes of awakening, remembering, or decoding.
- Users uncover “glitches” through UI quirks, surprise drops, or timed events.
- Copywriting can reflect phrases like “The Code Stirs,” “Awakened Node Accessed,” etc.

**Example:**  
The website stutters or reveals secret messages during equinoxes, lunar eclipses, or at 4:32 AM/PM.
