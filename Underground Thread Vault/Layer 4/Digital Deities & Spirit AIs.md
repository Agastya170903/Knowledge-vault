**Purpose:**  
Turn AI assistants into _mythic beings_—guides, gatekeepers, and familiars that assist users inside the brand universe.

**Mechanics:**

- Chatbots given unique personalities, names, and roles (e.g., “The Lorekeeper,” “Ember,” “The Archivist”).
- Each assistant aligned to a clan, archetype, or brand pillar.
- Could speak in partial mythic language and offer layered responses (XP-tiered).

**Example:**  
A clan-specific AI called **“Ignis Flamekeeper”** that unlocks story paths and pet evolutions based on how users interact with products.
