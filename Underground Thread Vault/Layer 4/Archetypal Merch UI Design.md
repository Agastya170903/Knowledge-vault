**Purpose:**  
Design digital platforms that reflect **clan identity, item rarity, and symbolic personalization**.

**Mechanics:**

- Clan-specific color palettes, typography, and motion graphics.
- Rare items glow, animate, or pulse with clan-colored auras.
- Users can unlock limited UI skins as part of XP or product unlocks.
- Pet avatars or smoke spirits walk across the screen or whisper secrets.

**Example:**  
A “Vault Clan” user sees metallic hex patterns with deep purple glow. Their pet “Shade Ember” sleeps on the checkout screen.
