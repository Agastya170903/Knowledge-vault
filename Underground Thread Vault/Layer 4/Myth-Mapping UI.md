**Purpose:**  
Transform digital interfaces into **symbolic spaces**—not just storefronts, but altars, archives, and gateways.

**Mechanics:**

- Website UI laid out like a temple or ritual site: glyph-based nav menus, hidden Easter eggs, and layered “rooms.”
- App features a “My Sigil” section where users track XP, pet growth, lore cards.
- Users explore brand mythology via layered clickable maps or clan-world interfaces.

**Example:**  
An app home screen with animated smoke trails guiding users to “The Archives,” “The Ritual Forge,” or “The Dream Gate.”
