**Purpose:**  
To increase **identity merging** with the brand through personalization — making users feel that part of them is **encoded into the object.**

**Triggers:**

- Color = Personality imprint
- Stickers = Ownership claim
- Clan Variants = Mythic alignment
- Pet names, glyph carvings = Ritual attachment

**Examples:**

- Custom skateboards, vape wraps, lighter stickers
- Clan-based color drops: Fire (red), Shadow (black), Myth (gold)
- Users paint/mark product packaging as initiation

**Applications:**

- Drop “blank gear” + sticker sheets = user-generated sigil tools
- Offer optional upgrades: _“Mark this with your name. This is now yours.”_
- Assign XP for user-submitted custom builds
