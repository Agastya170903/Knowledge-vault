**Purpose:**  
To create **visible social capital** around brand ownership — the rarer, more secret, or more early the item, the more symbolic power it carries.

**Triggers:**

- Founder Kit = Inner circle
- First 1000 Drop = OG access
- Secret Lore Access = Gatekeeping intelligence
- Unboxing online = Ritual status display

**Examples:**

- Supreme founder shirts = never reprinted
- iPhone unbox = class signal
- Early-access Discords, “citadel” channels, or private pages

**Applications:**

- Create Founder’s Card / Sigil → unlocks drop, lore, or bonus XP
- Build tiers of items not by quality — but by **mythic meaning**
- Give physical or digital proof of “first access”
- Host private rituals for verified early adopters
