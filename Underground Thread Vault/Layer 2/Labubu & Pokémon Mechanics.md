**Purpose:**  
To use collectible psychology, emotional projection, and rarity-based progression to form **parasocial attachment** to non-living brand objects.

**Core Triggers:**

- Rarity = Value
- Evolution = Identity investment
- Projected emotion = Parasocial bond (users name or “care for” objects)
- Collection = Completion compulsion → memory imprint

**Tactics:**

- Create “core vs alt” versions of every item (shiny, glitched, elemental variants)
- Pet evolution or smoke tool aging → creates _symbolic aging/attachment_
- Include a visual XP map or poster → users track their “evolution”

**Examples:**

- Labubu: Fans hunt secret variants, assign personalities
- Pokémon: Evolve through XP; name them, care for them, transfer trauma/protection
