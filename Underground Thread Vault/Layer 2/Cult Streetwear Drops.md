**Purpose:**  
To replicate the **scarcity rituals of streetwear cults** and tie identity to _when and how_ someone receives your product — not just what they get.

**Core Mechanics:**

- Drop Timing = Signals worth and urgency
- Limited Units = Creates conflict, status
- Rebuy Ritual = “Miss it and you’re out”
- Resell Layer = Creates external economic value

**Examples:**

- Supreme: Queue culture, 8-minute drops
- SNKRS App: Randomized access lottery
- Palace: “F**k you if you missed it” branding + loyalist culture

**Applications:**

- 3-minute ritual gate for specific drops
- “Only unlocked if…” tier access via repost, story share, or quiz
- Launch windows named like myths: _“The Eclipse Drop,” “Blood Gate,” “Vault Phase”_
