**Purpose:**  
To create **emotional relationships** with brand elements by making users _project_ identity, memory, and desire onto non-human objects or lore fragments.

**Triggers:**

- Naming items or pets
- Giving objects personality or lore
- Public storytelling (user-generated, reshared by brand)
- “This item was with me when…”

**Examples:**

- Fans naming plushies, decks, or lighters
- Pokémon and Tamagotchi = guilt/praise mechanic
- Collectible owners posting stories about first find, unboxing, or “bonded” tools

**Brand Applications:**

- Let users name their pets/gear publicly (stickers or tattoos)
- Encourage users to write “origin stories” of their first ritual
- Build XP bonus into story sharing loops
