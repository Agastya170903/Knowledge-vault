**Purpose:**  
To draw from global myth systems to create **emotional depth** and **sacred structure** behind your brand universe.

**Primary Myth Systems:**

- **Vedic** → Fire rituals, cyclical time, deities as frequencies
- **Norse** → Clan loyalty, world tree (Yggdrasil), warrior rites
- **Greco-Roman** → Dualism, hero's journey, divine interference
- **Sumerian** → Ancient kingship, underworld cycles, stargates
- **Egyptian** → Death/rebirth, judgment, soul weighing
- **Chinese Celestial** → Zodiac archetypes, balance, immortal masters

**Application:**

- Map products or drops to specific myth cycles
- Align marketing cycles with equinoxes, solstices, or celestial gates
- Use deities as internal "guardian roles" in your XP system
