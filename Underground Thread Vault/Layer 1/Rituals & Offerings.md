**Purpose:**  
To elevate brand interactions into **sacred moments** by embedding symbols from ancient offerings into product behavior.

**Ritual Mechanics:**

- 🔥 **Fire Rituals** = Lighting, burning, release (papers, incense, candles)
- 🌿 **Herbs & Incense** = Sensory cues for memory activation
- 🧊 **Cold/Heat Contrast** = Thermo-based memory association
- ⛩️ **Altars** = Box layout as altar, packaging folds as layers of initiation

**Examples:**

- Product burned as symbolic **offering** = user enters next XP tier
- Incense stick hidden in box = unlock ritual upon first use
- Matches with a branded mantra = activation tool
