**Purpose:**  
Transform brand identity into a **tribal structure** based on behavior or preference (e.g., Joint, Bong, Pipe, Dab).

**Mechanics:**

- Clan assigned during onboarding quiz or first purchase.
- Each clan has its own glyph, ritual, mythline, and perks.
- Cross-clan missions can unlock special events or dual drops.
- Clan-specific stories grow over time.

**Example:**  
The “Ignis” clan (Joint users) are warriors of flame, tied to rebellion, trickster archetypes, and passion.
