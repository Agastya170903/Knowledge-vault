**Purpose:**  
Turn collectible cards or inserts into **living pages of a mythos**. Give users _pieces of a forgotten story_.

**Mechanics:**

- Physical cards included in drops, packaging, or mystery boxes.
- Some are rare or faction-specific.
- Cards contain encrypted glyphs, sigils, coordinates, or story snippets.
- Scannable AR unlocks could animate the lore.

**Example:**  
One card describes “The Banishment of Aegir” but only makes sense when paired with another user’s card. Community lore pooling.
