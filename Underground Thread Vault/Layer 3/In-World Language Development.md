**Purpose:**  
Deepen immersion with **ritualistic language**, symbols, and community roles.

**Mechanics:**

- Introduce a lexicon of brand-specific roles: “Igniter,” “Smokekeeper,” “Lorebearer.”
- Use sigils and phrases in packaging, UX copy, and social captions.
- Encourage fan creations using the language (UGC loops).
- Align terms with archetypal energy and product tone.

**Example:**  
Instead of saying “Your Order is Confirmed,” say: “The Forge Has Lit. Your relics journey soon.”
