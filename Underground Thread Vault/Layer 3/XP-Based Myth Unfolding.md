**Purpose:**  
Let users _earn access_ to deeper layers of the brand mythology. Story is not told—it's **unlocked**.

**Mechanics:**

- XP gained through rituals (product use, reviews, referrals, story shares).
- QR codes or NFC tags embedded on packaging/products reveal new story fragments
- Unlock “myth chapters” tied to clan or personal archetype.
- Some lore fragments may only be revealed during celestial events or symbolic dates.

**Example:**  
A grinder with a hidden QR inside the lid. Scanning it after purchase unlocks a chapter about the Forge of Ignis.
