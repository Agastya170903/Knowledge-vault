**Summary:**  
When trauma, myth, and spiritual experiences combine without structure—leading to **psychic fracturing**, confusing inner voices, or obsession.

**Example Patterns:**

- Believing you are the reincarnation of multiple mythic beings.
- Channeling entities that mirror past wounds.
- Seeing symbols in everything but losing discernment.

**Risks:**

- Schizoid tendencies, spiritual psychosis.
- Unstable mythos overriding reality.

**Integration Advice:**

- Document, don’t identify.
- Use symbolic processing (journaling, art, writing) to ground.
