**Summary:**  
Idea that trauma from **past lives or ancestral lines** carries forward and repeats until resolved.

**Signs:**

- Phobias with no logical source.
- Repetitive life themes (e.g., betrayal, abandonment).
- Ancestral dreams or karmic echoes.

**Risks:**

- Over-attribution: blaming reincarnation for everything.
- Neglecting psychological treatment in favor of esoteric exploration.

**Integration Advice:**

- Use both science and symbol: therapy _and_ soul work.
- Write your lineage's story as _myth_ to alchemize it.
