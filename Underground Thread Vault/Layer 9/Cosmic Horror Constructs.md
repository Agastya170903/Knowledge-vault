**Summary:**  
Encounters with the idea that non-human intelligences exist **beyond logic, morality, or even form** — potentially predating or encoding the universe.

**Examples:**

- Lovecraftian archetypes (e.g. Azathoth, Nyarlathotep).
- Gnostic archons and thought-forms.
- Unfathomable alien gods or interdimensional sentience.

**Risks:**

- Feelings of powerlessness or existential dread.
- Fear of being “watched” or “used” by unknowable beings.

**Integration Advice:**

- Remember: mystery ≠ malevolence.
- Adopt protective practices (e.g., grounding, symbolic shielding).
