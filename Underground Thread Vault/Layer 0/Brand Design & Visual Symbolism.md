**Purpose:**  
To use visual elements as **mythic anchors** that trigger trust, memory, and resonance across brand touchpoints.

**Core Concepts:**

- Glyph = Compressed symbol carrying frequency or narrative
- Wordmark = Textual identity mirroring archetypal energy
- Lockup = Unified form of glyph + wordmark (use for sacred/signed messaging)
- Symmetry = Ancient visual harmony cues safety and intelligence
- Golden Ratio = Used in temple architecture and premium logos (ex: Apple, Twitter)

**Applications:**

- Use Vedic, Norse, or Sacred Geometry shapes in subtle UI elements
- Create variants of your logo to represent **clans**, **tiers**, or **drops**
- Design back-of-pack symbols tied to XP or pet evolution
