**Purpose:**  
To understand **why people buy emotionally** — and how to align product energy with identity, desire, or status.

**Core Triggers:**

- Dopamine Loop = Scroll → Trigger → Reward → Share
- FOMO = Fear of missing sacred drops or mythic access
- Belonging = Purchase signals inclusion in a cult, clan, or era
- Scarcity = Limited quantity triggers action and emotional attachment

**Tactics:**
- Limited-time “ritual drops” with countdowns
- Scarcity-laced language: _“First Flame,” “Last Relic,” “Only the Initiated”_
- Tiered kits based on **myth archetypes**
