**Essence:**  
Everything vibrates — and so **frequency determines form** (as shown in cymatics). Certain frequencies _entrain_ the brain or nervous system into different states.

**Important Frequencies:**

- **432 Hz** – “natural resonance,” heart-aligned, used in sacred music.
- **528 Hz** – “DNA repair,” linked to love, transformation.
- **963 Hz** – “pineal awakening,” mystical experience.
- **440 Hz** – Modern standard, sometimes considered _slightly dissonant_.

**Applications:**

- Meditation music
- Sound baths
- Healing rituals
- Water programming (charging water with tone)

**How to Use:**

- Switch music tuning to 432 Hz via pitch shifters or tools.
- Use binaural beats for state change (e.g., theta for deep vision).
- Chant mantras in tuned scales.
