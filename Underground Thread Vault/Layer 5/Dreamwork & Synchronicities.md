**Essence:**  
Dreams are **liminal gates** — personal myth factories where unconscious material becomes narrative. Synchronistic events are “external dreams,” guided by **nonlinear intelligence**.

**Practices:**

- Dream journaling: Log every dream upon waking for pattern recognition.
- Symbol decoding: Use universal (Jungian) and personal dream lexicons.
- Intentional dreaming: Ask specific questions before sleep.
- Synchronicity tracking: Note repeating symbols, numbers, or timing.

**Uses:**

- Receive guidance or warnings
- Heal unresolved emotions
- Connect to ancestors or spirit archetypes
- Enter lucid dreaming states for directed work
