**Summary:**  
A fringe historical theory positing the existence of a vast, technologically advanced empire—Tartaria—erased from mainstream history through global cataclysm (often referred to as a “mud flood”).

**Key Concepts:**

- Architectural anomalies: buried ground floors, ornate structures with no records of construction.
- World’s Fairs (e.g., Chicago 1893): cited as “reset events,” where grand structures were later demolished.
- Maps & Atlases: pre-20th-century maps label large swaths of Asia and Eurasia as “Tartary.”

**Applications:**

- Use as narrative metaphor for “forgotten greatness” in branding.
- Visual motif: domes, spires, free energy-style antennas.
