**Summary:**  
Some researchers claim ancient buildings (e.g., cathedrals, fireplaces, towers) were part of a now-lost communication and energy grid using atmospheric electricity.

**Key Symbols:**

- Tartarian antennas (on spires and domes).
- Orgone accumulators, etheric capacitors.
- Sound as energy transmission (cathedrals as resonant chambers).

**Applications:**

- Audio rituals or frequency-based lore.
- Use of 432 Hz or Schumann resonance references in product design.
