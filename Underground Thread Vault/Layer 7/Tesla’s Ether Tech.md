**Summary:**  
Nikola Tesla's theories of “radiant energy” and etheric fields have inspired modern claims of suppressed free energy technologies.

**Notable Concepts:**

- Wardenclyffe Tower: designed to wirelessly transmit energy using Earth’s resonance.
- Ether theory: precursor to modern zero-point field concepts.
- Alleged suppression: claims of sabotage or shutdown by energy cartels.

**Applications:**

- Brand aesthetics inspired by Tesla coils, resonance lines.
- “Ether kits” or symbolic tech-relic packaging.
