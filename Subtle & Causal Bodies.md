### **Subtle & Causal Bodies**

_(Layer 0–5: Foundations → Metaphysics & Soul Architecture)_

---

#### **1. Definition & Context**

- In **yogic, Vedantic, and esoteric traditions**, the **human being is multi-layered** — existing beyond the physical body.
    
- These layers are often referred to as **“sheaths” (koshas)** or **bodies**, each vibrating at different frequencies.
    
- The **Subtle** and **Causal** bodies are **higher-order vehicles of consciousness**, connecting the individual to their soul memory and the universal field.

#### **2. The Three Primary Bodies**

1. **Gross Body (Sthula Sharira):**
    
    - Physical, material body.
        
    - Functions: Basic survival, sensory experience.
        
2. **Subtle Body (Sukshma Sharira):**
    
    - **Pranic, emotional, and mental layers** that shape thoughts, desires, and personality.
        
    - Composed of:
        
        - **Pranamaya kosha:** Energy body (prana, chakras, nadis).
            
        - **Manomaya kosha:** Mental-emotional sheath (thoughts, feelings).
            
        - **Vijnanamaya kosha:** Higher intellect & intuitive wisdom.
            
3. **Causal Body (Karana Sharira):**
    
    - The **blueprint of the soul**, storing karmic imprints and deep subconscious seeds (_samskaras_).
        
    - **Holds the memory of all lifetimes**, desires, and evolutionary purposes.
        
    - Acts as the **bridge between the individual soul (Atman) and the universal consciousness (Brahman).**

#### **3. Functions & Characteristics**

- **Subtle Body:**

    - **Vehicle for astral travel & lucid dreaming.**
        
- **Causal Body:**

    - Only accessed in **deep meditation, near-death experiences, or higher mystical states**.

#### **4. Esoteric & Cross-Tradition Parallels**

- **Kabbalah:**
    
    - Subtle = **Ruach & Neshamah** (soul breath and higher intellect).

- **Theosophy:**
    
    - Subtle = **Astral & Mental Bodies**.
        
    - Causal = **Higher Mental / Buddhic Bodies** (vehicle of the soul’s evolution).
        
- **Buddhism:**
    
    - **Subtle:** Mindstream that carries karmic impressions.
        
    - **Causal:** **Alaya-vijnana (storehouse consciousness)** — repository of seeds for future experiences.
