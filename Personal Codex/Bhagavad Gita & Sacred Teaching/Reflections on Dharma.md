    _(Write in your own words: Is it duty? Alignment? A calling? Service?)_
    
- **Where do I feel my dharma most clearly?** _(In work? Family? Spiritual practice?)_
    
- **How does my dharma change in different roles?** _(Founder, son, friend, seeker.)_

### **2. Dharma & TRK (My Work)**

- **How is TRK an expression of my dharma?**
    
- **Am I building this brand for ego or for service?**
    
- **What responsibilities do I have to my customers, community, and culture?**

### **3. Dharma & Personal Life**

### **4. Dharma in the Gita**

_(Use verses as anchors.)_

- **2.47 — Karmanye vadhikaraste:** _Act without clinging to outcomes._
    
- **3.35 — Swadharme nidhanam shreyah:** _Better to live your own path imperfectly than someone else’s perfectly._
    

**Reflection:**

- _Where am I still chasing someone else’s idea of success instead of my swadharma?_
