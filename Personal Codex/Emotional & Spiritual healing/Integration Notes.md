_Transforming peak experiences into embodied wisdom._

### **1. Why Integration Matters**

- Insights from **plant medicine, meditation, or emotional breakthroughs** are like seeds — they only grow if you nurture them.
    
- Without integration, profound realizations **fade into memory** instead of changing behavior.
    
- Integration = **Turning “what I saw” into “how I live.”**

### **How to Use:**

- Fill this after **any deep session** — cannabis, meditation, trip, or emotional breakthrough.
    
- Link realizations to other parts of the Codex (e.g., `[[Triggers & Patterns]]` for insights on anger, or `[[Vision & Purpose]]` for life-altering decisions).
    
- Revisit **Follow-Up** after a week to see if you actually integrated the insight.
