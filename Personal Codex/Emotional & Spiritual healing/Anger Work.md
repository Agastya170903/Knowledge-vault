 ### **1. Understanding My Anger**

**Questions to explore:**

- What are my top 3 recurring anger triggers?
    
- What deeper wound do these triggers touch? (e.g., disrespect, feeling unheard, loss of control)
    
- How does my body signal anger before I even react? (tight jaw, heat, racing thoughts)

### **2. Gita on Anger (Krodha)**

> _“From attachment arises desire, from desire arises anger, from anger arises delusion, from delusion, the loss of memory, and from the loss of memory, the ruin of reason.”_ — **Bhagavad Gita 2:62–63**

**Reflection:**

- My anger isn’t random — it’s **attachment to how I want things to be**.
    
- When I react in anger, I lose **buddhi (discernment)**.
    
- My goal: **Pause → Observe → Respond**, not react.

### **3. Immediate Calming Techniques (In the Moment)**

- **Breath Reset:**
    
    - Inhale 4 → Hold 2 → Exhale 8 (repeat 5–7 times).
        
- **Physical Pause:**
    
    - Step out of the space. Wash face with cold water.
        
- **Mantra for Control:**
    
    - Silently repeat: _“I am not my anger. I am the witness.”_

### **4. Anger Release Practices (Post-Incident)**

- **Journaling:**
    
    - Write an uncensored letter about what triggered you. Don’t send it — just release.
        
- **Somatic Release:**
    
    - 1–2 mins of shaking arms/legs or push-up bursts to discharge stored energy.
        
- **Cooling Breath (Sheetali):**
    
    - Inhale through rolled tongue or pursed lips, exhale slowly through the nose (2–3 mins).

### **5. Long-Term Rewiring**

- **Pre-Framing Triggers:**
    
    - If I know I’ll meet a trigger (e.g., mother’s word), prepare: _“It’s only sound, not truth.”_
        
- **Reframing:**
    
    - Ask: _“What story am I telling myself about this moment? Is it true?”_
        
- **Spiritual Grounding:**
    
    - Apply **sandalwood or vibhuti** on the forehead post-shower with the intention: _“May I stay cool and steady.”_
        
- **Daily Gita Reading:**
    
    - 1–2 verses each morning to anchor myself in higher perspective.

### **How to Use:**

- After every trigger, **log the event** here or in `[[Triggers & Patterns]]`.
    
- Use **Immediate Calming** in the moment, and **Release Practices** later.
    
- Every week, **reflect on progress** to see if intensity/frequency of anger is reducing.
