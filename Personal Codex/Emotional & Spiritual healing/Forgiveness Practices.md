_Releasing the weight of resentment & guilt to live lighter and freer._

### **1. Understanding Forgiveness**

- **Forgiveness ≠ Forgetting:** It means **choosing not to let the pain control me.**
    
- **Forgiveness ≠ Approval:** It doesn’t make wrong actions right — it frees me from carrying them.
    
- **Self-Forgiveness:** Essential for growth; guilt without release becomes self-punishment.
    

> _“He who has conquered anger and forgives is ever content.”_ — **Bhagavad Gita 16:3**

### **2. Forgiveness Ritual for Others (5–10 mins)**

**Step 1: Set the scene**

- Light a candle or sit in stillness. Close your eyes.
    

**Step 2: Visualize the person**

- Picture them in front of you. Acknowledge what they did. Feel the hurt fully — don’t suppress it.
    

**Step 3: Speak or write:**

- _“What you did hurt me. But I choose not to carry this pain anymore. I release you and free myself.”_
    

**Step 4: Breathe it out**

- Deep inhale → long exhale imagining the anger leaving your body.
    

**Step 5: Close with mantra:**

- _“Om Shanti Shanti Shanti.”_
