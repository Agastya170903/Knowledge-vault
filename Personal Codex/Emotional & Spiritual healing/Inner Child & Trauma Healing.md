_Reconnecting with the younger me who still needs love, safety, and validation._

### **1. Why Inner Child Work Matters**

- **The “inner child”** holds your earliest experiences of joy, pain, and unmet needs.
    
- Unhealed wounds become **triggers in adulthood** (anger, shame, overreactions).
    
- Healing isn’t erasing the past — it’s **re-parenting yourself with compassion**.

### **2. First Steps: Meeting My Inner Child**

**Exercise:**

- Sit or lie down. Close your eyes.
    
- Picture **yourself at 6–10 years old** (or any age when you felt most vulnerable).
    
- Ask silently: _“What do you need from me right now?”_
    
- Write the answer in your journal.
    

**Prompt:**

- _“I see you. I hear you. I will protect you.”_

### **3. Journaling Prompts for Healing**

_(Do 1–2 prompts daily or weekly.)_

- _What moments in childhood made me feel unsafe or unseen?_
    
- _What did I need to hear back then but never did?_
    
- _Who did I need support from, and what would I say to them now?_
    
- _If my inner child could speak today, what would they say?_

### **4. Re-Parenting Practices (Daily/Weekly)**

- **Affirmation Ritual:** Look in the mirror and say:  
    _“I am safe. I am worthy. I give myself the love I needed then.”_
    
- **Soothing the Nervous System:**
    
    - Hug yourself or hold a pillow when triggered (physical reassurance).
        
    - Do **slow belly breathing** (inhale 4 → exhale 6) to calm fear responses.
        
- **Creative Expression:**
    
    - Draw, doodle, dance, or play like you did as a child.
        
    - Give your inner child space to **enjoy without judgment**.

### **5. Trauma Release Practices**

_(To process stuck emotions safely.)_

- **Somatic shaking:** 1–2 mins of shaking your arms, legs, and torso to release stored tension.
    
- **Safe venting:** Write letters to people/events that hurt you (don’t send them — burn or tear).
    
- **Guided meditation:** Visualize holding your younger self in a safe, protective space.

### **6. Weekly Reflection**

- **Did I notice my inner child being triggered this week? When?**
    
- **How did I respond? Did I comfort or criticize myself?**
    
- **One loving thing I can do for my inner child this week:**
