Harnessing the breath to awaken life force and higher states of consciousness.
### **1. Why This Work Matters**

- **Breathwork** calms the nervous system, clears emotional blocks, and expands awareness.
    
- **Kundalini awakening** (when done safely) awakens dormant life-force energy at the base of the spine, leading to heightened creativity, clarity, and spiritual growth.
