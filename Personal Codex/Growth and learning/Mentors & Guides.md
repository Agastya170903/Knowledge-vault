### **How to Use:**

- **Create one page per mentor** (e.g., `[[Kanchan Ma’am]]`, `[[Amit Uncle]]`, `[[Bhagavad Gita Teachers]]`).
    
- **Extract lessons & link them** to related areas (e.g., `[[Forgiveness Practices]]` or `[[Brand Vision]]`).
    
- Review this monthly to ensure you’re **applying what you’ve learned**, not just collecting advice.
